            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THis City has been filled for theſe ſeveral Days paſt, with great numbers of our Country-men, that are come from <hi>London</hi> in their way home, moſt of which are bound for <hi>Dublin,</hi> and parts adjacent; where we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all things are brought into a fine way of Settlement, both in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, as well as Civil; and His Majeſty in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties through which he has paſt, hath ſettled the Cities, Burroughs, and Corporations, upon their Old Eſtabliſhment, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the High Sherriffs, and the Militia, or Train'd Bands. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has been Attended, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by the Reverend Biſhops and Clergy, of the ſeveral Dioceſſes He has paſt through, and alſo by ſeveral <hi>Nonconforming</hi> Miniſters. My good Old Biſhop of <hi>Limerick</hi> has ſuffered a great loſs at his Houſe at <hi>Limerick;</hi> for the Counteſs of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> juſt before her going to <hi>France,</hi> procured ſome Armed Force of the Garriſon, with whom ſhe entred the Biſhops Houſe, (which was very well Furniſhed with all ſorts of Houſhold-Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and took from thence what ſhe thought fit; telling my Lord, That if he pleas'd he might reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf out of what ſhe had left in her Houſe in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and ſo ſhe rubb'd off with her Son to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104539:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The great Failure of the <hi>Lough,</hi> or that part of the River that lies near the City of <hi>Limerick,</hi> is very remarkable, and a thing which has not been known before, I am ſure, in my time, in the moſt dryeſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to become Fordable, which we hear is now in two or three places; which gives us a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſhew how Almighty God is pleaſed to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's moſt Juſt and Righteous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, by Faciliting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Rebels in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with ſo little loſs of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Blood: And in Order for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Bleſſing of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God on His Maieſty, Army, and good Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there is a Solemn Faſt kept very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every <hi>Friday,</hi> both in the Royal Camp, and in the ſeveral Cities and Towns in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are in Their Majeſties Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>It's the Opinion of many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here, That we ſhall have a Parliament, called in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have any <hi>Term;</hi> the Wind being at preſent contrary, we have nothing here very new from His Majeſties Gamp, tho we do not in the leaſt doubt, but that the firſt Pacquet that arrives will bring us the Confirmation of the Surrender of <hi>Lymerick.</hi> Our laſt left the Royal Army, Encamped very near <hi>Lymerick:</hi> The King's Head Quarters, being within half a Mile of the City; that upon part of our Army's approach very near the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Enemy made a Sally, with the chief Strength of the Garriſon; but were ſoon beaten in again, and in their Retreat to the Town, a great part of them were cut off; that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army which not long ſince made a conſiderable Body of Twenty Five Thouſand Men, were now dwindled to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconſiderable Number, and they retired (upon the Approach of Our Army) farther into the Countrey; great Numbers of all ſorts having quitted them ſome time before, who were retired over the Bogs to the Mountains and Caves, their Old Lurking-holes.</p>
            <p>You ſeem to wonder at the <hi>French</hi> quitting of the City of <hi>Lymerick;</hi> it is, as you writ, the ſtrongeſt place in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſtronger than that of <hi>Gallway,</hi> but the latter is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted far more Advantageous for the <hi>French,</hi> to get off to their own Countrey (which doubtleſs, if they are not already, they will be forc'd to it in a very little time.) The City of <hi>Lymerick</hi> is ſituated Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore long Miles from the Sen; now <hi>Gallway</hi> is but Nine Miles: The Haven of the City of <hi>Gallway</hi> is the moſt conſiderable in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Connaught,</hi> being a very great <hi>Bay,</hi> ſome Mile broad, and many more long, having in the Mouth Three Iſlands (called the Iſles of <hi>Arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

One Channel runneth betwixt the Land, and the Northern Iſle, and called therefore <hi>North-Sound.</hi> The Second, between the ſame Northern Iſle, and the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt, which Channel being the moſt uſual of the Three, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtiled St. <hi>Gregories Sound.</hi> And the Third, between the moſt Southermoſt Iſland, and the Main, named <hi>South Sound;</hi> in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the Ray, one may An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in Five or Six Fathoms of Water.</p>
